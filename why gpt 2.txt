In the code I shared earlier, we are using **GPT-2**, which is a small, lightweight language model from OpenAI. It is part of the Hugging Face model hub and can be easily loaded via the **`transformers`** library.

### Key Characteristics of GPT-2:
- **Model Type:** Autoregressive language model.
- **Size:** It comes in several sizes, with the smaller ones (e.g., `gpt2`) being suitable for tasks that don't require heavy computation.
- **Use Case:** GPT-2 is commonly used for text generation tasks like answering questions, completing sentences, and generating responses.

### Code Snippet (Loading GPT-2):
In the tutoring server code, the model is loaded with the following line:
```python
model = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
```

### Why GPT-2?
- **Lightweight:** GPT-2 is relatively small compared to models like GPT-3, making it suitable for tasks that need to run on limited resources, such as in your distributed system.
- **CPU-friendly:** GPT-2 can be run on CPUs (no GPU required), making it easier to integrate in environments with limited computational power.
- **Pre-trained for General Text Generation:** GPT-2 is trained on large datasets for general text generation, so it can answer common questions in a conversational style.

### Alternatives:
If GPT-2 is too resource-intensive or not quite what you need, you could consider using lighter alternatives like:
- **`distilGPT2`:** A distilled (smaller, faster) version of GPT-2.
- **spaCy or NLTK:** These libraries are more lightweight and can be used for simpler natural language processing tasks like rule-based responses.
